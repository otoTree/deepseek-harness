English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package provides model selection in the Web GUI: the `/model` popup command and the composer's model seat, both over one per-session directory of provider-grouped models. Choosing a model submits the complete selection — provider, model, and reasoning effort — which the Host snapshots at the next prompt-assembly boundary, so the following request uses it while a running step keeps its assembled selection. The composer seat shows a two-level Model/Effort menu: models stay provider-grouped, and the selected exact model supplies its adapter-owned effort names and default. When the Host reports that no adapter serves the session's route, the composer input goes inert until a route becomes available.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside `ui-conversation` and the commands package; the composer then shows the model seat next to the pending indicator, and `/model` opens the same directory as a popup. Both surfaces show the host-reported current selection when the exact provider/model pair remains in the advertised groups; a missing catalog row leaves the routable selection intact while the trigger prompts `Select model`.

### Model and effort

Models stay grouped by provider. The menu shows model and effort names only; catalog descriptions remain available to other consumers. The `/model` popup applies the selected model's default effort; the composer can then choose any advertised effort. An adapter without reasoning metadata leaves the Effort row absent; there is no arbitrary effort input.

### Unroutable sessions

When the Host reports that no adapter serves the session's route, this plugin raises a composer block and the input goes inert with its own copy; recovering clears it without a reload. A `null` before the first load or after one failed never blocks, and catalog membership never blocks either — a route serving a model it does not advertise is missing from the groups yet usable.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The `/model` popup and `conversation.input.model` seat share one `ModelDirectory` per Session and submit through `session.selectModel`. The resolver normally reuses the Host-generation `session.modelCatalog` read. An optional `registerCatalogSource` supplies Session-authorized presentation metadata to both entries; returning null retains shared discovery. Source removal restores shared discovery without changing the deployment default or durable selection. Source errors remain retryable, and connection reset or Session disposal cancels scoped reads and discards late results. Addressed subagent Sessions use neither selector. Forwarded adapter, settings and credential events refresh resident catalogs.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the model surface is not enough. They move from the browser surfaces to the command popup shell and the selection contract.

- [ui-commands](../ui-commands/README.md) — the popupSelect shell the `/model` contribution registers into.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares the composer's `conversation.input.model` seat and the composer block.
- [dsh-agent-default-model](../../core/agent-default-model/README.md) — the default-model service for sessions that never choose.
- [Client package map](../README.md) — adjacent browser UI packages.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the `session.selectModel` selection both entries submit: the Host snapshots the complete `ModelSelection` at the next prompt-assembly boundary and owns the model-visible effect, while a running step keeps its assembled selection.

#### KV Cache effect

Switching the route can reduce or invalidate provider-side cache reuse for subsequent requests; the prompt prefix itself is untouched.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current model surface. They are current package constraints, not a general model-router comparison or a task backlog.

- **No create-time or addressed-subagent selection** — both entries require an existing ordinary session's Agent; there is no draft-phase model choice to fold into session creation, and subagent continuation deliberately exposes no independent model-selection contract.
- **Directory names are presentation-only** — selection and persistence use provider/model/effort ids; a provider whose catalog or exact-model metadata lookup fails lists as an unselectable failure row until reload.
- **No arbitrary effort input** — the composer offers only the exact model's adapter-advertised levels; an adapter without reasoning metadata leaves the Effort row absent.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. A single command contribution registration whose disposal is proven by the HMR-safety spec — it emits no cordis events and owns no cross-plugin mutable state.
